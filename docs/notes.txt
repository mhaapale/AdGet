Use of Service API
----------------------
 Service:
  - Does not interact with user and operates on background
  - Runs context of main thread(UI thread)
  - User of service needs to create worker thread.
  - Can be impelented by intent-api or binder-interface, we use intent-api
  - stateless
  - after completed operation, shutdown the service


 Service Helper
 - Thin layer to preparing intents and handle binder callbacks on return path
 - Singleton to expose Async API to UI
 - Check if method already pending
     o implement map  (request id, intent)
 - Create the request intent
 - add operation tpye and unique request id
 - add method specific parameters
 - add the binder callback
 - call startService(intent)
 - return the request id, this can be later on to be used to see if request is still pending
 - dispatch callback to any listener, who likes to know result of this method
 - As little data as possible in callback

 Notes:
 - Never runs database operation on context of main thread. Soon you will run application not responding errors
